Data Structures

Through labs, I programmed a 
Stack (lab2), 
Queue (lab3), 
Linked List (lab4), 
Binary Search Tree (lab5), 
and a Heap (lab7).

I also implemented the selection sort (lab6), insertion sort (lab6), and heap sort (project3), 
and learned about the merge sort and quick sort. 

Through projects, I implmented these data structures for data processing and storage.
